# ProjectApp

This is my final project for the Angular course at Softuni. It implements an E-bike store with authentication, selling, wishlisting, and buying functionality. The app uses a Node.JS json api and an Angular front-end.

## Serve locally

1. Clone the repo. Type `git clone https://github.com/tomailiev/angular-project-app.git` in a terminal.
2. Navigate to the app folder and type `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Start the api by typing `npm run start:dev` in the terminal.
4. Serve the Angular app with `ng s` or `ng s --open` to open it in a new window on your default browser.

## Check it out in production mode

Navigate to https://angular-final-project-app.herokuapp.com/ in your browser to see the latest build in production.

## Test functionality

Create a user account through the register form. Upon logging in you with said account you will be able to create a listing, add an e-bike to your wishlist or cart, see and edit your profile, and see your listings/purchases.
